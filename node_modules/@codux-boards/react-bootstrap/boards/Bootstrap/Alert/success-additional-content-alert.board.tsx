                Aww yeah, you successfully read this important alert message.
                This example text is going to run a bit longer so that you can
                see how spacing within an alert works with this kind of content.

            <hr />
            <p>
                Whenever you need to, be sure to use margin utilities to keep
                things nice and tidy.
            </p>
